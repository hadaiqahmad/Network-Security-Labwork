The security attack is an attempt to destroy, expose, alter, disable, steal or gain unauthorized access to or makes unauthorized use of an asset. It is mainly classified into two main categories: (i) Passive Attacks, (ii) Active Attacks. The passive attacks, monitors unencrypted traffic; looks for clear-text passwords and sensitive information that can be used to launch other type of attacks. While, in active attacks, the attacker tries to bypass or break into the secure systems with the help of stealth, viruses, worms, or Trojan horses.
The purpose of this lab is to let the students become familiar with the attributes of a secure network that can resist both active and passive attacks. For this lab the students are required to perform two tasks (i) to surf the internet and list the attributes that a network must have to become a secure network and (ii) implement confidentiality service and exchange a message securely to another computer over the internet without using a secure socket.
